# Insight: A Quantitative Analysis Tool
Insight acts like a "Ctrl-f" for price action in the stock market. Users can input any trend and locate instances of similar trends in historical data, aggregating them together to forecast potential future patterns.

## How It Works
1. **User Selection:** The user highlights a region to select as the trend (green highlight).
2. **Algorithm Analysis:** Insight highlights instances of similar trends in historical data (shown in different colors).
3. **Aggregate View:** An aggregated view of all similar trends is stacked on top of each other, and a solid green line illustrates the average.

## Goal
Insight aims to:
- Provide an understanding of when and how stock price action has historically reacted to specific patterns.
- Serve as an analytical tool rather than a predictive algorithm, offering an edge in illuminating underlying tendencies in price action.
- Aid in more informed decision-making for traders and analysts.
